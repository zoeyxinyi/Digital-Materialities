Project Title: Evolution of a Dot into an Abstract Star

Introduction:
This document outlines the design process involved in creating a visual piece that illustrates the transformation of a simple dot into an abstract star using geometric shapes. The purpose is to provide insights into the decision-making process, tools used, and overall approach to the design.

Design Objective:
The primary objective of this visual design project is to convey the concept of evolution and transformation through the gradual development of a dot into an abstract star. The use of geometric shapes will enhance the visual appeal and create a cohesive and aesthetically pleasing composition.

Design Process:

-Conceptualization:

  Idea Generation: Brainstorming sessions were conducted to explore concepts related to transformation and evolution. The decision was made to focus on a simple dot 
  evolving into a complex abstract star to convey the theme effectively.
  Research: Studied various geometric shapes and their symbolic meanings to inform the design choices and ensure a thoughtful representation of the evolution concept.

-Sketching and Planning:

  Initial Sketches: Rough sketches were created to visualize the progression of the dot into a star. This phase involved experimenting with different shapes, sizes, 
  and arrangements.
  Composition Planning: Determined the overall layout, balance, and hierarchy of elements within the composition.

-Digital Design Process:
  Software Tools: shadertoy

Conclusion:

The visual design successfully captures the essence of evolution and transformation through a carefully planned and executed process. The combination of conceptual thinking, digital skills, and attention to detail contributes to a visually compelling representation of the journey from a dot to an abstract star.
